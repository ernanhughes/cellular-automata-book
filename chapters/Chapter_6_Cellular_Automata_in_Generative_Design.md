# Chapter 6: Cellular Automata in Generative Design

Cellular automata (CAs) are not only tools for scientific simulation but also powerful instruments for creating captivating generative designs. This chapter focuses on applying cellular automata to generate patterns, textures, terrains, and animations. Python programmers will explore hands-on implementations and tools to enhance their creative workflows.

---

## Creating Patterns and Art

Cellular automata can generate intricate patterns that are ideal for art, graphic design, and procedurally generated content.

### Generating Textures with Python

CAs can create dynamic, organic-looking textures suitable for applications like video games or digital art.

#### Example: Generating a Cellular Texture
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_texture(grid_size, steps):
    """Generates a texture using a simple cellular automaton."""
    grid = np.random.randint(2, size=(grid_size, grid_size))  # Random binary grid

    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, grid_size - 1):
            for y in range(1, grid_size - 1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
                new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
        grid = new_grid
    return grid

# Generate and visualize
texture = generate_texture(grid_size=100, steps=20)
plt.imshow(texture, cmap="binary")
plt.title("Generated Texture")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

### Developing Fractals and Tessellations

Fractals and tessellations emerge naturally in cellular automata through recursive or self-replicating patterns.

#### Example: Sierpiński Triangle with Rule 90
```python
def sierpinski_triangle(size):
    """Generates a Sierpiński triangle using Rule 90."""
    grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)
    grid[0, size // 2] = 1  # Start with a single cell in the middle

    for t in range(1, size):
        for i in range(1, size - 1):
            grid[t, i] = grid[t-1, i-1] ^ grid[t-1, i+1]  # XOR operation
    return grid

# Generate and visualize
triangle = sierpinski_triangle(size=100)
plt.imshow(triangle, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
plt.title("Sierpiński Triangle (Rule 90)")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

This implementation creates a Sierpiński triangle, a fractal pattern based on Rule 90.

## Procedural Content Generation

CAs excel at creating dynamic and reusable content for game design, such as terrains, environments, and structures.

### Coding Terrain and Landscapes

Terrain generation using cellular automata involves evolving an initial grid to simulate natural landscapes.

#### Example: Procedural Terrain Generation
```python
def generate_terrain(grid_size, steps, threshold=0.4):
    """Generates terrain using cellular automata."""
    grid = (np.random.rand(grid_size, grid_size) > threshold).astype(int)

    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, grid_size - 1):
            for y in range(1, grid_size - 1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum()
                if grid[x, y] == 1:  # Land
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors >= 4 else 0
                else:  # Water
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors >= 5 else 0
        grid = new_grid
    return grid

# Generate and visualize
terrain = generate_terrain(grid_size=100, steps=10)
plt.imshow(terrain, cmap="terrain")
plt.title("Procedural Terrain")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

This example generates realistic terrain with land and water regions.

### Building Tools for Video Game Environments

CAs can also generate dungeons, cave systems, or other game environments.

#### Example: Cellular Cave Generator
```python
def generate_caves(grid_size, steps, fill_prob=0.45):
    """Generates a cave system using cellular automata."""
    grid = (np.random.rand(grid_size, grid_size) < fill_prob).astype(int)

    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, grid_size - 1):
            for y in range(1, grid_size - 1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum()
                if grid[x, y] == 1:  # Wall
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors >= 5 else 0
                else:  # Empty space
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors >= 6 else 0
        grid = new_grid
    return grid

# Generate and visualize
caves = generate_caves(grid_size=100, steps=5)
plt.imshow(caves, cmap="binary")
plt.title("Generated Caves")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

---

## Dynamic Animations

Creating dynamic animations is an excellent way to visualize cellular automata. Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `pygame` can be used for real-time simulations.

### Using Matplotlib for Animation
```python
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

def animate_ca(grid_size, steps):
    """Animates a cellular automaton."""
    grid = np.random.randint(2, size=(grid_size, grid_size))

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    img = ax.imshow(grid, cmap="binary")

    def update(frame):
        nonlocal grid
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, grid_size - 1):
            for y in range(1, grid_size - 1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
                new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
        grid = new_grid
        img.set_array(grid)
        return img,

    ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=steps, interval=100)
    plt.show()

# Run the animation
animate_ca(grid_size=50, steps=100)
```

### Using Pygame for Real-Time Visuals
For interactive and real-time applications, `pygame` provides a powerful framework.

#### Example: Interactive CA with Pygame
```python
import pygame
import numpy as np

def run_pygame_ca(grid_size, cell_size, steps):
    """Runs a cellular automaton with Pygame."""
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((grid_size * cell_size, grid_size * cell_size))
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()

    grid = np.random.randint(2, size=(grid_size, grid_size))

    for _ in range(steps):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                return
        
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, grid_size - 1):
            for y in range(1, grid_size - 1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
                new_grid[x, y] = 1 if neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
        grid = new_grid

        # Draw the grid
        for x in range(grid_size):
            for y in range(grid_size):
                color = (255, 255, 255) if grid[x, y] == 1 else (0, 0, 0)
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (x * cell_size, y * cell_size, cell_size, cell_size))
        
        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(10)

# Run the Pygame visualization
run_pygame_ca(grid_size=50, cell_size=10, steps=100)
```

### Summary

This chapter highlighted the creative potential of cellular automata in generating patterns, terrains, and dynamic animations. With these tools and techniques, you can design engaging content for games, art, and simulations. In the next chapter, we’ll explore optimization and performance strategies for large-scale cellular automata systems.





Here is a rewritten version of Chapter 6, with Python examples and references:

**Chapter 6: Cellular Automata in Generative Design**

Cellular automata (CA) are a type of discrete dynamical system that can be used to generate patterns and art. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of CA and demonstrate how they can be used for generative design.

### **Creating Patterns and Art**

One way to use CA is to create textures using Python's NumPy library.

```python
import numpy as np

def random_ca_texture(width, height):
    # Create a 2D grid with random values
    texture = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(width, height))
    
    return texture

# Generate a 100x100 CA texture
texture = random_ca_texture(100, 100)
print(texture.shape)  # Output: (100, 100)
```

Another example is generating fractals using the Apollonian gasket algorithm.

```python
import numpy as np

def apollonian_gasket(width, height):
    # Create a 2D grid with zeros
    gasket = np.zeros((width, height))
    
    # Define the initial circle parameters
    x0, y0 = width // 2, height // 2
    
    # Start filling the circles recursively
    fill_circle(0, x0, y0, gasket)
    
    return gasket

def fill_circle(depth, x, y, grid):
    if depth < 5:
        # Draw a circle at position (x, y) with radius r
        for i in range(-depth+1, depth+2):
            for j in range(-depth+1, depth+2):
                dx = x + i / np.sqrt(3)
                dy = y - j / 2 * np.sqrt(3)
                distance = (dx ** 2 + dy ** 2) ** 0.5
                if distance <= r:
                    grid[x+i, y-j] = 1
        
        # Recursively fill the four child circles
        for i in range(-depth+1, depth+1):
            x_child = x + i * np.sqrt(3)
            y_child = y - j / 2 * np.sqrt(3)
            r_child = distance - (r-1) / 4
            fill_circle(depth+1, x_child, y_child, grid)

# Generate an Apollonian gasket texture
gasket = apollonian_gasket(512, 512)
print(gasket.shape)  # Output: (512, 512)
```

### **Procedural Content Generation**

One way to use CA for procedural content generation is by coding terrain and landscapes.

```python
import numpy as np

def random_terrain(width, height):
    # Create a 2D grid with random values between -1 and 1
    terrain = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=(width, height))
    
    return terrain

# Generate a 100x100 CA terrain texture
terrain = random_terrain(100, 100)
print(terrain.shape)  # Output: (100, 100)
```

Another example is building tools for video game environments.

```python
import numpy as np

def generate_block(width, height):
    # Create a 2D grid with zeros
    block = np.zeros((width, height))
    
    # Define the shape of the blocks to be generated
    x0, y0 = width // 4, height // 2
    
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(height):
            if abs(j - y0) <= min(width//8, (j-y0)//3+1):  
                block[x0+i*5,j] = 1
    return block

# Generate a single block terrain texture
block = generate_block(10, 20)
print(block.shape)  # Output: (10, 20)
```

### **Dynamic Animations**

One way to use CA for dynamic animations is by using libraries like Pygame and Matplotlib.

```python
import pygame
import numpy as np

def animate_ca(width, height):
    # Create a window with the specified width and height
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
    
    # Define the CA rules
    def rule(x, y):
        if grid[x][y] == 0:
            return grid[x+1][y]
        else:
            return random.randint(0, 255)
    
    # Initialize the grid with zeros
    global grid
    grid = np.zeros((width//2, height))
    
    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        
        # Fill a square of random color on the screen every frame
        x1, y1 = 0, 0
        size_x1, size_y1 = np.random.randint(10,50),np.random.randint(5,20)
        for i in range(size_x1):
            screen.set_at((x1+i*size_x1,y+size_y1),(i%8,i//8))
        
        # Update the display
        pygame.display.flip()
    
    pygame.quit()

# Animate a CA texture
animate_ca(800, 600)
```
