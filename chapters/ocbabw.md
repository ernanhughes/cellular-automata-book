    Args:

        incremental_budget (int): Incremental computing budget in each step.
        total_budget (int): Total simulation budget.
        simulate (function): Function to simulate a design and return a performance metric.

    # Step 1: Perform initial simulations
    allocations = np.full(num_designs, initial_budget)  # Initial allocations
    total_allocated = num_designs * initial_budget

    return best_design

# Example Usage
def simulate_design(design_index):
    """Simulate a design and return a performance metric."""
    true_means = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]  # Hypothetical true means for 3 designs

### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an equal number of simulations (`initial_budget`) for each design.
   - Compute the mean performance for each design.

2. **Incremental Budget Allocation**:
   - Incrementally add the computing budget (`incremental_budget`).
   - Use a rule (e.g., variance-based or Theorem 5.1) to allocate more replications to designs with higher uncertainty or better performance.

3. **Simulation**:
   - Perform additional simulations for each design as determined by the new allocation.
   - Update the mean performance metrics.

4. **Termination**:
   - Stop when the total allocated budget exceeds the `total_budget`.
   - Return the design with the highest mean performance as the best design.

### Example Output
```
Iteration 1: Total Allocated = 15
Iteration 2: Total Allocated = 25
Iteration 3: Total Allocated = 35
...
Best Design Found: Design 3 with Mean = 2.0034
```

### Customization
- Adjust the `simulate_design` function to match the performance metric of your designs.
- Modify the `compute_budget_allocation` function to implement specific allocation strategies.
