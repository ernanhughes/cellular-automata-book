# Chapter 4: Customizing and Extending Cellular Automata

This chapter focuses on going beyond traditional cellular automata by introducing custom rules, multi-dimensional grids, and stochastic elements. Python programmers will learn how to design versatile systems that expand the horizons of cellular automata, enabling simulations of increasingly complex and realistic phenomena.

## Designing Custom Rules

Custom rules allow you to tailor cellular automata to specific problems or behaviors. Unlike fixed rule sets (e.g., Rule 30), custom rules let you modify state transitions based on unique logic.

### Writing Python Functions for Rule Sets

Custom rules can be implemented as Python functions that take the current cell state and its neighbors as inputs.

#### Example: Custom Rule in 2D
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def custom_rule(grid, x, y):
    """Custom rule for state transition."""
    neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
    if grid[x, y] == 1:  # Alive
        return 1 if neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
    else:  # Dead
        return 1 if neighbors == 3 else 0

def apply_custom_rule(grid, steps):
    """Applies the custom rule over multiple steps."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, rows-1):
            for y in range(1, cols-1):
                new_grid[x, y] = custom_rule(grid, x, y)
        grid = new_grid
        yield grid

# Initial grid
grid = np.zeros((20, 20), dtype=int)
grid[9, 9] = grid[9, 10] = grid[9, 11] = grid[10, 10] = 1  # Glider-like structure

# Simulate and visualize
for step, g in enumerate(apply_custom_rule(grid, steps=10)):
    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
    plt.imshow(g, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
    plt.title(f"Custom Rule - Step {step+1}")
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```

### Exploring Edge Cases and Behaviors

When designing custom rules:
1. Test for edge cases such as boundary conditions (e.g., wrap-around grids).
2. Evaluate stability and emergent properties, such as oscillations or chaos.
3. Add debug visualizations to verify that transitions behave as expected.

#### Example: Debugging Edge Cases
```python
# Debugging the behavior of edges
print(f"Initial State:\n{grid}")
for i, g in enumerate(apply_custom_rule(grid, 2)):
    print(f"After Step {i + 1}:\n{g}")
```

## Multi-Dimensional Grids

Extending cellular automata to three or more dimensions allows the simulation of volumetric phenomena, such as fluid dynamics, diffusion, and even 3D patterns in generative art.

### Transitioning from 2D to 3D Automata

#### Example: 3D Cellular Automaton
```python
def initialize_3d_grid(size):
    """Initializes a 3D grid."""
    grid = np.zeros((size, size, size), dtype=int)
    grid[size//2, size//2, size//2] = 1  # Activate the center
    return grid

def apply_3d_rule(grid, steps):
    """Applies a 3D rule over multiple steps."""
    size = grid.shape[0]
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, size-1):
            for y in range(1, size-1):
                for z in range(1, size-1):
                    neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2, z-1:z+2].sum() - grid[x, y, z]
                    new_grid[x, y, z] = 1 if neighbors in [4, 5] else 0
        grid = new_grid
        yield grid

# Initialize and simulate
grid = initialize_3d_grid(size=20)
for step, g in enumerate(apply_3d_rule(grid, steps=3)):
    print(f"Step {step + 1}: Total Active Cells = {np.sum(g)}")
```

### Applications in Volumetric Simulations

- **Diffusion**: Simulating the spread of particles in 3D space.
- **Physics**: Modeling structures like crystals or magnetic domains.
- **Art**: Generating 3D patterns for rendering or 3D printing.

#### Visualization Tip:
Use libraries like `matplotlib` for 3D plots or `mayavi` for advanced visualization.

## Stochastic Cellular Automata

Stochastic automata introduce randomness into rule evaluation, making them ideal for simulating probabilistic systems like diffusion, noise, and random growth.

### Adding Randomness to Rules

#### Example: Random Activation
```python
def stochastic_rule(grid, x, y, prob=0.1):
    """Stochastic rule with a probability threshold."""
    neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
    if np.random.rand() < prob:  # Random chance to activate
        return 1
    return 1 if neighbors == 3 else 0

def apply_stochastic_rule(grid, steps, prob):
    """Applies a stochastic rule over multiple steps."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, rows-1):
            for y in range(1, cols-1):
                new_grid[x, y] = stochastic_rule(grid, x, y, prob)
        grid = new_grid
        yield grid

# Initialize and simulate
grid = np.zeros((20, 20), dtype=int)
grid[9:11, 9:11] = 1  # Random patch
for step, g in enumerate(apply_stochastic_rule(grid, steps=5, prob=0.1)):
    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
    plt.imshow(g, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
    plt.title(f"Stochastic Rule - Step {step+1}")
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```

### Simulating Noise and Probabilistic Systems

Stochastic cellular automata can be used for:
1. **Noise Generation**: Simulate random patterns for texture or testing.
2. **Biological Models**: Capture probabilistic behaviors like mutation or infection spread.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Model uncertainty and randomness in physical systems.
