# Chapter X: Leveraging Foundation Models for Discovering Cellular Automata Patterns

Cellular Automata (CA) have fascinated researchers for decades due to their ability to model complex systems through simple rules. The advent of Artificial Intelligence, particularly vision-language foundation models (FMs) like CLIP, has opened up new avenues for automating the discovery of novel CA patterns. In this chapter, we explore how these models can be integrated into CA research, enabling automatic identification of interesting patterns, behaviors, and open-ended simulations. We’ll also provide practical Python implementations to illustrate these concepts.

## 1. Introduction to Foundation Models in CA Research

Foundation models (FMs) are large pretrained neural networks capable of processing multimodal data such as images and text. These models can evaluate CA simulations by embedding their rendered states into a human-aligned representation space. By doing so, they facilitate tasks such as:

1. Discovering simulations that match a specific visual or textual description.
2. Identifying CA rules that lead to open-ended, novel behaviors.
3. Mapping the diverse space of CA behaviors systematically.

The method described in the paper, **Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL)**, provides a framework for integrating FMs into CA research. Using ASAL, researchers can:

- Perform **target searches** to find simulations matching specific prompts.
- Identify **open-ended simulations** that exhibit continuous novelty.
- Illuminate the space of all possible CA simulations to discover diverse phenomena.

## 2. Setting Up the Framework

We’ll begin with a Python setup that integrates foundational models with CA simulations.

### Installation and Requirements

Before running the examples, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision clip-by-openai numpy matplotlib
```

Additionally, you’ll need the [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and a basic CA simulator.

## 3. Implementing Cellular Automata

Here’s a basic implementation of a binary-state CA inspired by Conway’s Game of Life:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class CellularAutomata:
    def __init__(self, size, ruleset):
        self.size = size
        self.grid = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(size, size), p=[0.7, 0.3])
        self.ruleset = ruleset

    def step(self):
        new_grid = self.grid.copy()
        for i in range(1, self.size - 1):
            for j in range(1, self.size - 1):
                neighbors = self.grid[i-1:i+2, j-1:j+2].sum() - self.grid[i, j]
                if self.grid[i, j] == 1:
                    new_grid[i, j] = 1 if neighbors in self.ruleset['survival'] else 0
                else:
                    new_grid[i, j] = 1 if neighbors in self.ruleset['birth'] else 0
        self.grid = new_grid

    def display(self):
        plt.imshow(self.grid, cmap='binary')
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.show()

# Example usage
rules = {'birth': [3], 'survival': [2, 3]}
ca = CellularAutomata(size=64, ruleset=rules)
for _ in range(5):
    ca.display()
    ca.step()
```

## 4. Integrating CLIP for Pattern Discovery

### Loading the CLIP Model

CLIP can embed images and text into a shared representation space, enabling us to measure their similarity.

```python
import torch
import clip
from PIL import Image

# Load CLIP model
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device=device)
```

### Searching for Target Patterns

We define a function to evaluate CA patterns against a textual description:

```python
def evaluate_pattern(ca_grid, prompt):
    # Convert CA grid to an image
    img = Image.fromarray((ca_grid * 255).astype(np.uint8))
    img = preprocess(img).unsqueeze(0).to(device)

    # Encode text and image
    text = clip.tokenize([prompt]).to(device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        image_features = model.encode_image(img)
        text_features = model.encode_text(text)

    # Compute similarity
    similarity = torch.cosine_similarity(image_features, text_features)
    return similarity.item()
```

### Example: Finding a Specific Pattern

Let’s search for a CA rule that generates a pattern resembling “self-replicating molecules.”

```python
rules_list = [
    {'birth': [3], 'survival': [2, 3]},
    {'birth': [3, 6], 'survival': [2, 3, 5]},
    # Add more rules here
]

def search_rules(rules_list, prompt):
    best_rule = None
    best_similarity = -1
    for rules in rules_list:
        ca = CellularAutomata(size=64, ruleset=rules)
        for _ in range(10):
            ca.step()
        similarity = evaluate_pattern(ca.grid, prompt)
        if similarity > best_similarity:
            best_similarity = similarity
            best_rule = rules
    return best_rule, best_similarity

prompt = "self-replicating molecules"
best_rule, similarity = search_rules(rules_list, prompt)
print("Best Rule:", best_rule)
print("Similarity:", similarity)
```

---

## 5. Open-Ended Simulation Search

To find CA rules that exhibit open-ended behaviors, we measure novelty over time using CLIP embeddings.

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

def compute_novelty(history, current_embedding):
    return min(cosine(current_embedding, h) for h in history)

def open_ended_search(rules, steps=50):
    ca = CellularAutomata(size=64, ruleset=rules)
    history = []
    novelty_scores = []

    for _ in range(steps):
        ca.step()
        img = preprocess(Image.fromarray((ca.grid * 255).astype(np.uint8))).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
        with torch.no_grad():
            embedding = model.encode_image(img).cpu().numpy()
        history.append(embedding)
        novelty_scores.append(compute_novelty(history[:-1], embedding))

    return np.mean(novelty_scores)
```

## 6. Conclusion

By integrating foundation models into CA research, we unlock powerful tools for automating the discovery of novel patterns and behaviors. Through supervised target searches and open-ended novelty measurements, researchers can explore vast spaces of CA rules systematically and efficiently.

In the next chapter, we will delve into real-world applications of these techniques, including modeling ecosystems and simulating artificial intelligence dynamics.
