# Chapter 3: Classical Cellular Automata

Classical cellular automata (CAs) represent some of the most well-studied and iconic examples of how simple rules lead to complex and emergent behaviors. In this chapter, we will implement foundational models such as the 256 elementary rules and Conway’s Game of Life, and we will explore extensions like multi-state automata and popular variants.

## Implementing Elementary Cellular Automata

Elementary cellular automata (ECA) are one-dimensional CAs where:
- Each cell has two states: `0` (off) or `1` (on).
- The next state depends on the current state and the states of the two neighbors.

There are **256 possible rule sets**, each defined by the transition for all combinations of neighbor states.

### Coding the 256 Rules

To represent the rules programmatically, use an 8-bit binary number, where each bit defines the output for a specific neighborhood configuration. For example, **Rule 30** corresponds to `00011110` in binary.

#### Python Implementation:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_eca(rule_number, size, steps):
    """Generates a 1D elementary cellular automaton."""
    # Convert the rule number to an 8-bit binary representation
    rule_bin = f"{rule_number:08b}"
    rule_dict = {
        (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[0]),
        (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[1]),
        (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[2]),
        (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[3]),
        (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[4]),
        (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[5]),
        (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[6]),
        (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[7]),
    }
    
    # Initialize the grid
    grid = np.zeros((steps, size), dtype=int)
    grid[0, size // 2] = 1  # Start with a single active cell in the middle
    
    # Apply the rule for each step
    for t in range(1, steps):
        for i in range(1, size - 1):
            neighborhood = (grid[t-1, i-1], grid[t-1, i], grid[t-1, i+1])
            grid[t, i] = rule_dict[neighborhood]
    
    return grid

# Visualization
def visualize_eca(grid, rule_number):
    """Visualizes the 1D elementary cellular automaton."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.imshow(grid, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
    plt.title(f"Elementary Cellular Automaton - Rule {rule_number}")
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
rule_number = 30  # Choose Rule 30
size = 101  # Grid size
steps = 50  # Number of time steps

eca_grid = generate_eca(rule_number, size, steps)
visualize_eca(eca_grid, rule_number)
```

## Conway’s Game of Life

The **Game of Life**, invented by John Conway, is a 2D cellular automaton where:
- The grid consists of cells in two states: alive (`1`) or dead (`0`).
- The next state depends on the cell's neighbors based on the following rules:
  1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
  2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
  3. All other live cells die, and all other dead cells remain dead.

### Developing an Efficient Simulation

#### Python Implementation:
```python
def game_of_life(grid, steps):
    """Simulates Conway's Game of Life."""
    def count_neighbors(grid, x, y):
        """Counts the live neighbors of a cell."""
        neighbors = [
            grid[x-1, y-1], grid[x-1, y], grid[x-1, y+1],
            grid[x, y-1],                grid[x, y+1],
            grid[x+1, y-1], grid[x+1, y], grid[x+1, y+1]
        ]
        return sum(neighbors)

    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, rows-1):
            for y in range(1, cols-1):
                live_neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)
                if grid[x, y] == 1:
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if live_neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
                else:
                    new_grid[x, y] = 1 if live_neighbors == 3 else 0
        grid = new_grid
        yield grid  # Use generator for step-by-step visualization
```

### Visualizing Gliders, Oscillators, and Spaceships

#### Example: Glider
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Initial grid with a glider pattern
grid = np.zeros((20, 20), dtype=int)
glider = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
for x, y in glider:
    grid[x, y] = 1

# Simulate and visualize
steps = 10
for step, g in enumerate(game_of_life(grid, steps)):
    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
    plt.imshow(g, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
    plt.title(f"Game of Life - Step {step+1}")
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```

## Extending Classic Models

Beyond binary states, cellular automata can be extended to include:
1. **Multiple States**: Cells can take on more than two states (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
2. **Custom Rules**: Define new transition rules to simulate unique behaviors.

### Example: Multi-State Cellular Automaton
```python
def multi_state_ca(grid, steps, num_states):
    """Simulates a multi-state cellular automaton."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_grid = grid.copy()
        for x in range(1, rows-1):
            for y in range(1, cols-1):
                neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].ravel()
                total = np.sum(neighbors) % num_states
                new_grid[x, y] = total
        grid = new_grid
        yield grid
```

### Exploring Variants

1. **HighLife**: Similar to Conway’s Game of Life but includes an additional rule: a dead cell with 6 live neighbors becomes alive.
2. **Seeds**: All live cells die in each step, and a dead cell becomes alive only if it has exactly 2 live neighbors.

#### Example: HighLife Rule Implementation
```python
def highlife_rule(grid, steps):
    """Simulates HighLife cellular automaton."""
    # Similar to Game of Life but with additional birth condition
    ...
```
