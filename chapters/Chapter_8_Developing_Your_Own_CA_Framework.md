# Chapter 8: Developing Your Own CA Framework

Building your own framework for cellular automata (CA) allows you to create modular, reusable, and extensible code that can adapt to various applications. This chapter walks through developing a Python library for CA development, creating flexible APIs, implementing unit testing and debugging strategies, and presenting a modular ecosystem simulator as a case study.

---

## Building Reusable Modules

A CA framework should be modular to allow easy integration of different grid types, rule sets, and visualizations.

### Writing a Python Library for CA Development

#### Example: Basic Structure of a CA Library
Organize your code into a modular library with reusable components:
```
ca_framework/
    __init__.py
    grid.py
    rules.py
    automaton.py
    visualization.py
```

#### Example: Implementing Core Components
1. **Grid Module (`grid.py`)**:
   - Manage grid initialization and state updates.

```python
import numpy as np

class Grid:
    def __init__(self, size, state_func=None):
        """Initializes the grid."""
        self.size = size
        self.grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)
        if state_func:
            self.grid = state_func(size)

    def update(self, new_grid):
        """Updates the grid state."""
        self.grid = new_grid

    def get_state(self):
        """Returns the current grid state."""
        return self.grid
```

2. **Rule Module (`rules.py`)**:
   - Define rule sets as functions or classes.

```python
def game_of_life_rule(grid, x, y):
    """Implements Conway's Game of Life rules."""
    neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2].sum() - grid[x, y]
    if grid[x, y] == 1:
        return 1 if neighbors in [2, 3] else 0
    else:
        return 1 if neighbors == 3 else 0
```

3. **Automaton Module (`automaton.py`)**:
   - Manage the evolution of the grid using the rule set.

```python
class Automaton:
    def __init__(self, grid, rule):
        """Initializes the cellular automaton."""
        self.grid = grid
        self.rule = rule

    def step(self):
        """Executes a single step."""
        size = self.grid.size
        new_grid = np.zeros_like(self.grid.grid)
        for x in range(1, size - 1):
            for y in range(1, size - 1):
                new_grid[x, y] = self.rule(self.grid.grid, x, y)
        self.grid.update(new_grid)
```

4. **Visualization Module (`visualization.py`)**:
   - Provide functions to visualize the grid.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_grid(grid, title="Cellular Automaton"):
    """Visualizes the grid."""
    plt.imshow(grid, cmap="binary", interpolation="none")
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()
```

---

### Creating Flexible APIs for Custom Rule Sets

A good CA framework should allow users to define custom rules and integrate them seamlessly.

#### Example: Flexible API for Rules
```python
class Automaton:
    def __init__(self, grid, rule):
        self.grid = grid
        self.rule = rule

    def step(self):
        size = self.grid.size
        new_grid = np.zeros_like(self.grid.grid)
        for x in range(1, size - 1):
            for y in range(1, size - 1):
                new_grid[x, y] = self.rule(self.grid.grid, x, y)
        self.grid.update(new_grid)

    def run(self, steps):
        for _ in range(steps):
            self.step()

# Example Usage
from rules import game_of_life_rule
from grid import Grid
from visualization import visualize_grid

grid = Grid(20)
grid.grid[9:11, 9:11] = 1  # Initialize grid
automaton = Automaton(grid, game_of_life_rule)

automaton.run(5)  # Run for 5 steps
visualize_grid(grid.get_state(), title="Game of Life")
```

---

## Unit Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are essential to ensure the reliability of your framework.

### Writing Tests for CA Components

Use Python's `unittest` module to validate individual components.

#### Example: Unit Tests
```python
import unittest
from grid import Grid
from rules import game_of_life_rule

class TestCAComponents(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_grid_initialization(self):
        grid = Grid(10)
        self.assertEqual(grid.grid.shape, (10, 10))
        self.assertTrue((grid.grid == 0).all())

    def test_game_of_life_rule(self):
        grid = np.array([[0, 1, 0],
                         [1, 1, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0]])
        result = game_of_life_rule(grid, 1, 1)
        self.assertEqual(result, 1)  # Cell stays alive

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Debugging Common Issues in CA Implementations

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Ensure edge cases (e.g., grid edges) are handled properly.
   - Use padding or periodic boundary conditions to avoid errors.
2. **Rule Errors**:
   - Visualize intermediate steps to verify rule application.
   - Add logging or assertions to catch unexpected states.

## Case Study: A Modular Ecosystem Simulator

Let’s build a modular ecosystem simulator using the framework we developed.

### Requirements
1. **Prey-Predator Model**:
   - Prey reproduce and spread.
   - Predators hunt prey and starve if no prey are nearby.
2. **Grid-Based Simulation**:
   - Each cell represents a habitat.

### Implementation
```python
from grid import Grid
from automaton import Automaton
from visualization import visualize_grid

def prey_predator_rule(grid, x, y):
    """Prey-predator simulation rule."""
    neighbors = grid[x-1:x+2, y-1:y+2]
    prey_count = (neighbors == 1).sum()
    predator_count = (neighbors == 2).sum()

    if grid[x, y] == 1:  # Prey
        return 1 if predator_count == 0 else 0  # Prey eaten by predator
    elif grid[x, y] == 2:  # Predator
        return 2 if prey_count > 0 else 0  # Predator starves
    else:  # Empty space
        return 1 if prey_count > 2 else 0  # Prey reproduces

# Initialize grid
size = 20
initial_state = lambda size: np.random.choice([0, 1, 2], (size, size), p=[0.7, 0.2, 0.1])
grid = Grid(size, initial_state)

# Create and run automaton
automaton = Automaton(grid, prey_predator_rule)
automaton.run(10)

# Visualize
visualize_grid(grid.get_state(), title="Prey-Predator Ecosystem")
```

Here is the chapter on "Developing Your Own CA Framework" with Python examples and references:

**Chapter 8: Developing Your Own CA Framework**

In this chapter, we will explore how to build a reusable framework for developing Concurrency Alternatives (CAs), focusing on building modular components, writing unit tests, and debugging common issues. We'll also present a case study of creating a full-featured Python package.

**Building Reusable Modules**

To develop a robust CA framework, it's essential to write modules that are flexible, reusable, and well-documented. Here's an example of how you can create a modular CA component in Python:

```python
# my_ca_component.py

class MyCAComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Simulate some work being done by the component
        print("Running component...")
```

In this example, we've created a simple `MyCAComponent` class that has an `__init__` method to initialize its state and a `run` method to perform some simulation of work.

To make this component reusable across different CA frameworks, consider adding APIs for custom rule sets:

```python
# my_ca_component.py (continued)

class MyCAComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self, rules):
        # Apply the provided rules to simulate behavior
        print("Applying rules:", rules)
```

This API allows other parts of your framework or external libraries to provide custom rule sets for this component.

**Creating Flexible APIs**

To create flexible APIs for custom rule sets, consider using Python's `typing` module and type hints:

```python
# my_ca_component.py (continued)

from typing import Dict

class MyCAComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self, rules: Dict) -> None:
        # Apply the provided rules to simulate behavior
        print("Applying rules:", rules)
```

In this example, we've added type hints for the `rules` parameter using Python's `typing.Dict` type. This allows IDEs and other tools to provide better autocompletion and code inspections.

**Unit Testing**

Writing unit tests is crucial for ensuring that your CA framework components work as expected. Here's an example of how you can write a simple unit test for the `MyCAComponent` class using Python's built-in `unittest` module:

```python
# my_ca_component_test.py

import unittest
from my_ca_component import MyCAComponent

class TestMyCAComponent(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_run(self):
        # Create an instance of the component
        component = MyCAComponent()

        # Call the run method with some sample rules
        component.run({"rule1": "value1", "rule2": "value2"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we've created a simple test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a single test method (`test_run`) to verify that the `run` method of our component works correctly.

**Debugging**

Common issues in CA implementations include configuration errors or unexpected behavior. To debug such issues, consider using Python's built-in debugging tools and modules:

```python
# my_ca_component.py (continued)

import pdb

class MyCAComponent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def run(self, rules):
        # Simulate some work being done by the component
        print("Running component...")

def debug_run(component: MyCAComponent, rules: Dict) -> None:
    try:
        # Call the run method with sample rules
        component.run(rules)
    except Exception as e:
        pdb.set_trace()  # Break into debugger

# Usage example
component = MyCAComponent()
debug_run(component, {"rule1": "value1", "rule2": "value2"})
```

In this example, we've added a `pdb` module call to break the execution of our code at the point where an exception occurs. This allows us to step through our code and inspect variables.

**Case Study: A Modular Ecosystem Simulator**

To demonstrate how to develop a full-featured Python package for CA development, consider creating a modular ecosystem simulator:

```python
# my_ecosystem_simulator.py

import argparse
from my_ca_component import MyCAComponent

def parse_args():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Ecosystem Simulator")
    parser.add_argument("--num_components", type=int, default=1)
    parser.add_argument("--rule_set", type=str, required=True)
    return parser.parse_args()

def main():
    # Parse command-line arguments
    args = parse_args()

    # Create components and initialize their rule sets
    components = [MyCAComponent() for _ in range(args.num_components)]
    rules = {"rule1": "value1", "rule2": "value2"}

    # Run the simulator with provided rule set
    for component in components:
        component.run(rules)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we've created a command-line tool (`my_ecosystem_simulator`) that takes two arguments: `num_components` and `rule_set`. We then create multiple instances of the `MyCAComponent` class with different rule sets.
